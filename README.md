# save_SL_elephants_from_trains

This project aims to prevent the deaths of Sri Lankan elephants caused by trains. In Sri Lanka, trains pass through national parks where elephants roam freely, leading to over 50 elephant fatalities each year.

The goal of the project is to develop a radar/lidar-based early warning system for train drivers.
